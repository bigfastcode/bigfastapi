- Create the requirements.txt and copy the content from here. Install all requirements
- Make a folder called db and copy the database.py file from here

  CORSMiddleware too. You can look in the main.py here to see everything you should import
- Copy the env file sample from here into your new project
- Clone the BigFastAPI repo. Cut out the BigFastAPI folder (the one with users.py only) and paste in your new project
