# Software Pattern
-----

The main file of an endpoint has to contain all the endpoints and external items related
to that. For example, comments.py has to contain the definitation of all GET and POST that
have to do with comments. The parts that handle the API are at the top of the file, and the
parts that are API independent (the services) are at the bottom of the file, with a comment
separating them

Inside the models folder, a corresponding file with the models for that endpoint should belong
created that contains the model. For example, we have a comments_model.py file in the models
folder. This file has to contain the definition of the model, as well as all functions that
are related to retrieving data.

A single model, e.g a 'comment' can be thought of as an OOP entity. The functions of this class
have to be anything that manipulate that particular comment, for example - edit_comment, save_comment
and so on. All these belong as class functions.

Inside this same file, we have as file-level functions all functions that act on a list of comments.
For example get_all_comments, create_new_comment and so on. All these will be in the comments_models.py
file.

If a piece of functionality has multiple models, they go into the same file. For example, auth.py could
have two models - Sessions and Tokens. These all go in the same models file.

All other functionality related to the endpoint has to be in the other file. That means we have just two
files for each functionality - the main file and the models file. These files should not import any other
files so far as possible.

A schemas folder for all the pydantic schemas.

# Imports

When importing the schema and the model, simply refer to them as schema and model in the way below

from .models import file_models as model
from .schemas import file_schemas as schema

# Naming Variables
---

Models should be capitalised, e.g class User, and should inherit from bigfastapi.database. This should be
imported as import bigfastapi.database as database.

All functions should be like this: def get_country_states(country_code: str):

Underscores should not be used to name any variables.

# Errors
---

Check for all possible errors and raise a FastAPI errors


# Documentation

All API functions should be documented in the controller file. Each controller file should have a summary
section at the top.

# functions

A space after function declaration before the body. Add comments for all endpoint functions
